<!-- The defer attribute tells the browser not to wait for the script. Instead, the browser will continue to process the HTML, build DOM.
 The script loads “in the background”, and then runs when the DOM is fully built.

 The async attribute means that a script is completely independent:
  The browser doesnt block on async scripts (like defer). -->
